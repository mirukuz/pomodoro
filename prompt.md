Preparation:
1. ok now we have a basic app that can run a floating circle, can we add one more feature: allow user to drag the circle around the screen

Features:
1. the circle should display time counting down, let's make the default time counting down 25 minutes, it just just display the time like "25:00", when time is up, it should display "00:00"
2. when user click on the circle, it starts counting down, when user click on the circle again, it stops counting down
