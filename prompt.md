Preparation:
1. ok now we have a basic app that can run a floating circle, can we add one more feature: allow user to drag the circle around the screen

Features 1:
1. the circle should display time counting down, let's make the default time counting down 25 minutes, it just just display the time like "25:00", when time is up, it should display "00:00"
2. when user click on the circle, it starts counting down, when user click on the circle again, it stops counting down

Feature 2:
- let's now trigger the Pomodoro timer counting down not by click, but by detecting user active behaviours on the screen, e.g. moving mouse, typing, etc.
